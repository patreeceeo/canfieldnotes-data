    "description": " Inspired by the great dystopian novelists, beats and countercultural luminaries to think playfully yet seriously about systemic problems, yet I am not as severely impacted by these problems by virtue of my arbitrary privilege as a fairly normal white male. I aim to milk this privilege for all it's worth, speaking truth to power. Impressions pass through my consciousness searching for someone to give them expression. I take on as many as I can and must decide the best medium to use. Sometimes writing, sometimes visual art, sometimes code, sometimes all three. I hope in the future that'll include music, sculpture, etc. To document it all here is the goal. I must confess, almost every single word is stolen, I just remix them."
