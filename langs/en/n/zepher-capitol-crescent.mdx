Soon I'll be climbing aboard a train to visit my parents across the continent. Here's my itenerary. It's going to take four days! I decided to splurge on a sleeper car. Will update with photos and relections during the trip.

## Amtrak Bus
### San Francisco => Emeryville

The concrete and glass of downtown have a golden glow as I ride across the bay bridge. It's yawning and slowly casting a blanket of fog into the bay.

## Amtrak California Zepher
### Emeryville => Chicago Union Station

I realize I didn't book the sleeper car for this segment of the trip (I blame Amtrak's clunky online booking website.) I climb upstairs into coach and select a window seat on the right. I hear the Amtrak slip checker guy coming up behind me and quickly stuff the rest of my bread in my mouth. He doesn't seem to take any notice of my bread-filled mouth. He just asks for the destination slip I'd been given by the ticket checking guy. I mumble something handing it to him, he writes my destination on it and slots in above my seat. Several minutes later I accept that I choose the wrong side for the good views of the SF bay so I switch over to the left and the slip checker guy is kind enough to move my slip over there for me.

I hop over to the observation car as we near the 7000ft peak of our ascent and share a booth with some friendly older folks from Guerneville. There's snow on the ground. We're rolling along the edge of the American canyon which which I manage to get some glimpses of, but couldn't get any pictures or videos because it's crowded.

Most of my day consists of napping and working on my laptop. I get a burger from the cafe. It's about as good as it looks. We stop in Winnemucca, Nevada, and we're allowed to get off for fresh snowy air.
